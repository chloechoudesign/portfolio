            Ethical or sustainable fashion takes into account the full lifecycle of the product and looks at everyone and everything being affected by it, from the environment, to the workers. It’s quite incredible to think we might change the world through fashion. There are brands working diligently to help make a difference. While doing our research, we came across lemlem.
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
              Upon first glance, lemlem looks like any other boutique that transferred its sales online. But, that was the problem: it looked like your average boutique instead of the recognized brand in the fashion industry that it is. Some other key issues were that their mission statement and cause was not clear and their website visuals conveyed a very different impression of their price point from what it truly was.
          </div>
          <div class="paragraph">
             Our goal is to create an enhanced shopping experience with educating users on the mission at the homepage as well as bringing luxury-focused user interface to match up with product pricing.

              On the homepage, some main UI issues that we noticed that are:

                <li>There are no clear messages or call to actions above the fold.</li>
                <li>They have such a great cause and amazing story, but they’re not properly represented on the homepage and has been instead, tucked away into the end of their navigation.</li>

              On the product page, we noticed there are inconsistent colors and font choices. The overall design looks like a Shopify theme and is very basic, outdated, and not well-maintained.

              To have a better understanding of Lemlem website’s strengths and weaknesses, we’ve conducted competitor analysis. We chose two direct and indirect competitors. Direct competitors were clearly showing their mission statement and brand story on the homepage with charts and images. Other brands were providing high-quality content imagery, and their modern and clean design adds credibility to their price point.

             In order to understand the problems of the existing website and the needs of target customers in-depth, we created a user research plan and conducted interviews and surveys.
            </div>
             <div class="paragraph">
              We interviewed 5 people and got similar results as in the SWOT analysis. Most of the participants said the brand story wasn't properly displayed on the homepage, and the high price didn't fit the website's overall look and feel.

                  <li>82% said they would like to see a cost analysis.</li>

                  <li>62% said they rarely see the "About Us" page.</li>
                </ul>
              Due to this research data, we have decided to place a mission statement on our home page and a cost breakdown chart on each product page.

                When visiting a fashion e-commerce site for the first time, Kelly — a frequent shopper that loves contributing — needs to know about the cause behind the brand in order to create a sense of trust and increase her interest in their products despite high price points.

              <div class="paragraph">
                Kelly was browsing Instagram and daydreaming about a long vacation in Mexico after the pandemic. On her friend’s story, Kelly sees a gorgeous swimsuit and taps on the brand’s tag, scans their Instagram, and explores their website. She is drawn in by the modern interface and loves that their products help women artisans in Africa thrive. Feeling inspired, she completes her first purchase during that same visit. A week later, Kelly receives her purchase in the mail, posts a photo of her new swimsuit, and tags @lemlem!
              </div>
              <div class="paragraph">
                After creating this scenario, we began to feel Kelly excitement which increased our empathy and further motivated us.

                 <li>The CTA styles: We opted for a cleaner CTA style with a carrot instead of a boxy CTA</li>
                <li>The design of the Featured Section on the homepage: From what a user said, it was too different than the rest of the homepage layout, so we switched that out for a horizontal scroll, which translates well from the mobile design</li>

              Originally in our mid-fidelity, we had our Handmade in Africa messaging as just text at the bottom of the category page. But with just plain text, it’s susceptible to being overlooked with it being that far down the page. Now, by adding in an image with the text, users also have context with an image to really process the messaging.

             For the product page after the A/B test, we further iterated with adding a <b>cost breakdown</b>. Since transparency was such a key part in our redesign and in our research. Though these numbers are fabricated, we’d like to inquire real numbers if we are able to get in touch with the stakeholders at lemlem.

                  Through our design process, we collaborated very closely from the start to allow us to align our goals early on and we learned how to communicate design changes frequently and efficiently to each other. We also helped each other with troubleshooting and challenged each other to exhaust all possible decisions.

                <div class="small-header">Collaborate efficiently</div>
                Additionally, because of COVID-19, we learned how to navigate the challenges of collaborating remotely as a team. Scheduling and dividing up work as well as choosing the best prototyping tool to work with. Most of us were more familiar with Adobe XD, but Figma was stronger with collaboration. So we decided to prototype in Figma and learn through the process.
